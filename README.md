# unified-governance-access-portal
this project consists of a map, that allows users to access all kinds of civic information at once.

The master map is built using Google MyMaps.

Different layers are added for different types of civic information, such as: dry waste collection centres, BBMP ward offices, government schools.

Different icons and colours will be assigned for different layers.

When a marker is clicked, all relevant information should pop up on the screen. For example, if a dry waste collection centre marker is selected, the following information should pop up: name of agency, ward assigned, working hours, material costs, location, ward name.

When using MyMaps, only .csv format should be used.

A few databases in .csv format are already uploaded in the repository (dry waste collection centre database, corporator office database).

A few databases need to be created: organic waste proccessing unit database, leaf litter processing database.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to these databases.

Locations of centres should be written as latitude and longitude only (no addresses). format: latitude, longitude (eg: 12.504956, 77.294850)
